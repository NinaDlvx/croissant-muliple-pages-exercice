        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
        shape of the Austrian kipferl, but made with a different type of dough.
        Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened
        dough.

      <h2>Variants</h2>
      <p>
        Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any praline, almond
        paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes
        like pain au chocolat, which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or
        sliced to include sweet or savoury fillings. It may be flavored with
        dried fruit such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits such as apples.
        <br />In <strong>France and Spain</strong>, croissants are generally
        sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with
        almond filling. In the United States, sweet fillings or toppings are
        sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with ham and cheese.
        In <strong>Germany</strong>, croissants are sometimes filled with
        Nutella or persipan.

        A cousin of the croissant is the Italian cornetto or brioche. These
        variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely
        true: the French version tends to be crispy, whereas an Italian cornetto
        or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the <i>cornetto vuoto</i> is
        commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include
        <i>crema pasticciera</i>
        (custard), apricot jam or chocolate cream. They often come covered with
        powdered sugar or other toppings. Cornetto with cappuccino at the bar is
        one of the most common breakfasts in <i>Italy</i>.
